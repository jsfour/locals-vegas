        <p class="style4">&quot;The Brahma Shrine on the north lawns of Caesars Palace is an authentic replica of one of Thailand's most popular Buddhist shrines. The original was installed more than 30 years ago at the Erawan Hotel in Bangkok to ward off bad luck after the hotel had suffered various disasters during its construction. Troubles were said to have ended after the installation, and the hotel enjoyed success. Through the years, the Thai shrine has also been associated with good fortune and prosperity. It was cast in bronze and plated in gold. Its housing is pre-cast concrete covered with tiny pieces of beveled glass and measures 14 feet high. Both the statue and the casing were assembled at Caesars Palace after air shipment in pieces. Their estimated total weight is more than 8,000 pounds. <br />
            <br />
          Formal dedication ceremonies at Caesars on February 5, 1984, were conducted under the supervision of Buddhist monks, with a troupe of 21 Thai dancers and musicians participating. Since that time, many visitors have expressed gratitude for wishes granted by offering flowers, joss sticks (incense), financial contributions (which Caesars donates to charities in Thailand) or by placing small wooden elephants nearby. Some have released live sparrows or arranged the services of dancers to perform at the statue, in keeping with customary observances.&quot;</p>
        <p class="style4">Caesars Palace says the Brahma Shrine is &quot;a tribute to an ancient culture, and a wish for prosperity and good luck to all who visit the resort.&quot; </p>
