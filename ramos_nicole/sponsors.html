          <p><strong>&quot;The Caesars shrine, the only one of its kind in the Western world, was fashioned in Thailand. Its ceremonial pouring in Bangkok on November 25, 1983, was attended by nuns, priests and Thai dignitaries. The statue was a gift to Caesars from Thai newspaper tycoon Kamphol Vacharaphol and his wife Praneetslipa and from Mr. Yip Hon, a leading citizen of Hong Kong.&#13;&quot;</strong></p>
          <p><strong>There is an urban legend that Cho Yun Fat's character in the movie Du Shen, God of Gamblers is the person who financed the building of the shrine. He was gambling, about to make the house bankrupt. The hotel told him he could have anything he wants as long as he didn't gamble anymore that day. He requested to have the shrine built on the casino grounds. </strong></p>
          <p><strong>It is not known if this character is Mr. Vacaharapol or Yip Hon, both of whom are extremely wealthy. Mr. Vacharapol started a newspaper and also funded schools in Thailand. Yip Hon was a professional gambler from South China. </strong></p>
