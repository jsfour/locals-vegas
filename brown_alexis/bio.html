        <p class="headline">About Webmistress: Alexis Brown</p>
        <p class="normal_text">-By Omar Lopez-Monteon</p>
        <p class="normal_text">There are moments that change our lives; some can be good things that happen or   tragic things. Either way they are moments that change our lives forever.   Sometimes though, those moments come when we help others, by changing their   lives, the ripples that we have caused also affect ours. </p>
        <p class="normal_text">          Alexis Nichole   Brown of Las Vegas had such a moment while volunteering for her second term in AmeriCorps, the   U.S. version of the Peace Corps. One day a veteran of the Vietnam War, who was   about 50, asked her how to spell a word. After she did, he asked her to look   over what he was writing and asked for help in using a computer. After   complying, the veteran thanked her for the help, but moreover, for not laughing   at him. He told her of how, during high school, he could not read very well and   got laughed at, causing him to clamp up. After the war, he still never really learned   how to read and he told her of how he was laughed at when asking for   help. He confessed that his deepest desire was to be able to write a love letter to his wife , all by himself. </p>
        <p class="normal_text">          The compassion shown by Alexis that day fueled   his confidence to keep trying so that one day his deepest wish could be   fulfilled. That day Alexis was also touched. </p>
        <p class="normal_text">&ldquo;I learned simplest thing you   can do for someone, can mean the world to them,&rdquo; Alexis said, &ldquo;and not to take   for granted the simplest things we can do like read.&rdquo; </p>
        <p class="normal_text">          Alexis was born in San Diego, California on December 25, 1985. She moved   to Las Vegas when she was ten with her mother and father who are both retired Navy senior   chiefs. Her sister, eight years her senior, followed years later with her two children. </p>
        <p class="normal_text">Alexis is a typical youth. She has a   MySpace account where she can be found blogging, as this is one of her favorite   pastimes.  She also likes singers Selena, J-Lo, and Mariah Carey. One of the quirks Alexis claims to   have is that she loves to sing whenever she can, sometimes even at inappropriate   times, and she often sings people&rsquo;s names. </p>
        <p class="normal_text"> Alexis lives with her   grandmother, mother, and aunt. Her dad lives down the street and her sister only   five minutes away. She has a father-son pair of Rat   Terriers, Buddy and Raider, who Alexis claims are crazy. Once, at PetCo, they ran   around her until she was tied up and then they escaped from their leashes.   Raider is a drama king who has caused midnight trips to the vet only to find out   it was something as slight as a cramp or to get attention. A mere sneeze will   get him to act as if he is hurt and dying. </p>
        <p class="normal_text">She graduated from Clark High School as a Principal Scholar,   gaining the Millennium Scholarship and was accepted to UNLV. She graduates December 2007 with a degree in print journalism. She started her path towards journalism as a copy   girl for her mom&rsquo;s bowling newsletter then, during her sophomore year of high school, she   volunteered to help write for the school newspaper. Junior and   senior year she officially joined the newspaper and also R-Jeneration, a program   by the Las Vegas Review-Journal that hosts a section with students writings with stories directed towards youth. </p>
        <p class="normal_text">Alexis committed to two   terms in AmeriCorps. From October 2004-May 2005, she promoted literacy to at-risk youth in the Boys and Girls Clubs of Las Vegas. Then, from October 2005-August 2006, she served as a volunteer coordinator networking with local agencies and volunteers to provide classes and resources to homeless veterans for the United States Veterans Initiative.    Her motivation for joining AmeriCorps was her ultimate goal of joining the Peace Corps, which she learned about in junior high school. </p>
        <p class="normal_text">          After   graduating, Alexis plans to explore what the world has to offer. However, it   could quite possibly involve helping people, because she is inspired by the history   behind her name. Alexis comes from a Christian background as a Seventh-Day   Adventist and, since her sister was named for a city near Bethlehem, Alexis was going to be named  Medina, another city located in the region close   to Jerusalem. However, her biological father objected (stating that Medina sounded like Medusa) and her mother opted with  a variation of the name   Alexander, from Alexander the Great. The name means defender of mankind. Her   middle name of Nichole is a variation of Nike, the winged Greek goddess of   victory. The name means victor. She equates her last name Brown to her African   American heritage. All together, she equates them as meaning someone who   victoriously defends people of all color. She means to accomplish this by using   her skills as a writer and reporter. </p>
        <p class="normal_text">Alexis' passion is fueled by the most    influential in her life: her mom. Alexis feels that her mother has   raised her well, and has set high standards. Alexis&rsquo; mother is also very honest   person. All this and more make Alexis feel very proud   of her mother and she wishes her make her mother equally proud. </p>
