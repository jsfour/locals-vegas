      <p><strong>Are you a little nervous about skydiving? Not sure what to expect?</strong></p>
      <p class="style1">For first time jumpers, it is recommended that you jump tandem. This means a certified and experienced tandem instructor will take you on your first jump. The instructor will teach you the proper body position to safely fall through the sky. You will be fitted with a tandem harness that will attach you to your instructor, and you can participate as much or as little as you would like.  </p>
      <p class="style1">Then enjoy a 15-minute scenic flight up to 10,000 feet above ground. You will travel through the air at 120 miles per hour for approximately 50 seconds, when it's time to deploy your parachute. Once under canopy, your instructor will guide you through flying and landing the canopy safely. </p>

      <p><strong>Helpful hints for first time jumpers. Have fun! </strong></p>
      <p class="style1">Wear athletic shoes. No boots, sandals, flip-flops, or high-heeled shoes are allowed.</p>
      <p class="style1">Wear comfortable clothing. Clothes should be fitted to your body to avoid any loose clothing from flying up during your fall. Remember, you are falling at 120mph. This means that your clothes will fly up, your skin will stretch, your cheeks will flap, your hair will blow. </p>
      <p class="style1">You can minimize this by wearing a shirt that is tucked in or an under-shirt. You can also wear long sleeves to cover your arms. (Note: you may wait up to an hour to jump depending on how many jumpers are scheduled that day. The Skydive Mesquite hangar is not air-conditioned, and the summer temperatures are HOT. Bring lots of water, sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat. Once in the air, the temperature cools off, and can be as much as 30 degrees cooler than ground temperature) </p>
