Operation Freefall&trade; is an organization that aims to put an end to sexual assault. It raises funds for SOAR (Speaking Out Against Rape Inc.&trade;) and local anti-sexual violence organizations across the country.</span></p>

      <p class="style1">Operation Freefall&trade; was born in 2001 when, on the anniversary of her rape   SOAR&trade; founder, Kellie Greene, made her first jump. In doing so, she successfully   reclaimed the day that had been taken from her, reviving her own courageous   spirit and turning what had been a dreaded memorial into an anticipated   celebration. Each year since then, more people joined Kellie, and her jump has   attracted national attention from television programs such as Oprah, The View,   Extra, and Today.</p>
