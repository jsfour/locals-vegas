<p align="center" class="style5">Why Play Frisbee Golf: The Benefits of Exercise</p>
<p align="center" class="style5">Frisbee Golf at Sunset Park is a great way to get outside, enjoy the parks scenery, and hang out with friends. </p>
<p align="center" class="style5">It is no secret that mild amounts of exercise combined with healthy eating and exposure to fresh outdoor air can benefit a person's general health. Depending on the physical fitness level of a participant, one round of frisbee golf 3 times a week could lead to weight loss and an improvement in general well being. One round of frisbee golf at Sunset park is the rough equivalent to walking over 1.5 miles. Between chasing after your discs, and walking tee to tee, your body will perform enough light cardio exercise to raise your heart rate and this, when paired with a healthy diet, will lead to light overall weight loss. </p>
<p align="center" class="style5">In addition to adding a light physical activity to your daily routine a switch from smokey restaurant or workplace air, your lungs will thank you for providing them with fresh oxygen to breath. Smoking directly can lead to many diseases such as lung cancer, high blood pressure, and even hypertension, all of which shave years off of your life. Even if you do not smoke, second hand smoke has proven to lead to similar diseases in non-smokers. By performing light exercise OUTSIDE, you increase the purity of oxygen your body is breathing. The more pure the air the higher the oxygen content. When your muscular system is breathing more oxygen it will replenish your muscles faster, and thus you will burn more calories. </p>
