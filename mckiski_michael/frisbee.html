<p align="center"><strong><span class="style5">Frisbee Golf: Picking the Right Frisbee</span></strong></p>
<p align="center" class="style6">When it comes to picking a Frisbee disc to use there are many theories on which discs are best. Most of the professional disc golf players and some of the more serious amateur players use a three disc golf approach. This means they use a different disc for each of three distances: drives, medium attempts, and putter shots. This is not necessary however, as most Frisbee Golf players tend to use only one disc while playing the entire game. Below you will find a description of each type of disc and a link to a web site where you can purchase these discs. </p>

  <table width="751" height="463" border="1">
    <tr>
      <td height="181" align="center" valign="top" class="style6"><p>Long Range Approach</p>
      <p>Typically a small disc in terms of thickness and diameter. These discs are designed to fly the farthest with accuracy. When trying to aim your disc while maintaining a long distance throw you should use a disc designed for this exact purpose. The problem with this disc is that it would be more difficult to perform a putter type of shot, as without the high velocity this disc loses accuracy. </p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td height="219" align="center" valign="top" class="style6"><p>Medium Range Approach</p>
      <p>These discs are built exactly as their name would imply. These discs are of medium thickness and diameter. These discs, if rotating, would typically be used on your second or third throws depending on distance to the basket. These discs would not typically be used as an initial driver if you have a long range disc available, unless it is a short range hole. If you were simply going to buy one disc to compete with for all of your shots, this would be the disc to buy. It works moderately well at both long range and putting, and will save you money while leaving you fairly competitive against a player using multiple discs. </p>

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td align="center" valign="top" class="style6"><p>Short Range Approach</p>
      <p>These discs are used almost exclusively for short range low velocity attempts at the basket. These discs are typically designed to be a little thicker and a little larger in diameter. As they are larger they are also heavier and are not designed to travel long distance. They do however maintain a great deal of control while traveling at a lower velocity from a short range towards the basket. This disc is ideal for putting and horrible for the original tee shot. </p>
