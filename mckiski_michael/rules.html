    <ol>
      <li><strong class="style5" align="left"><span class="style6">	1. Frisbee Golf is played very much like regular golf, with the equipment being the main difference. Instead of a set of club</span></strong><span class="style6"><strong>s and golf balls, players must use a flat frisbee disk. Similar to golf where a player would switch clubs based on how long of a shot is needed in a given situation; a Frisbee Golf Player can switch disks throughout the round based on how long of a flight is needed in a given situation.</strong></span></li>
        <li></li>
        <li><strong><span class="style6">2. In order to start a round of Frisbee Golf the players must first locate the first &quot;tee&quot;. Much like regular golf this is the point where the players must start their approach towards the first basket. In some courses there will be a sign designating exactly where to start, other courses will designate a small area and allow players to determine where they start within that pre-determined area. At Sunset Park you will find a concrete starting area provided as a starting point. </span></strong></li>
        <li></li>
        <li><strong><span class="style6">3. After a player takes their initial throw, that player will then wait as the other players take their initial throws. At this point strategy comes into play, in a friendly game of Frisbee Golf it is not uncommon for a player to use the same disc to make all of their attempts. However in a more competitive game, players may switch discs depending on the type of shot needed. Many different types of discs are made and more information can be found in the <a href="frisbee.html"><span class="style10">&quot;FRISBEE&quot;</span></a> section of this web site.</span></strong></li>
    </ol>
    <ol>
      <li><strong><span class="style6">4. After the first attempts at the basket have been made, the subsequent order is determined by the players' distance from the basket, with the player farthest from the basket going next. The players then play in that order regardless of the amount of turns required. For example: If player one's initial attempt lands 100 feet away from the basket, and player two's initial attempt lands him 200 feet away from the basket, then it will be player two's turn next. If on his second attempt player two's disc lands 125 feet away from the basket, it will be his turn again as he is still farther from the basket then player one. Not until player two's disc lands closer to the basket then player one's will player one take his second turn.</span></strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="style11">5. The hole is over when the players have successfully made their Frisbee Discs into the Basket. Repeat these steps for the entire round until you have completed all of the holes on the course. The player who finishes the game with the lowest amount of throws will be declared the winner. </li>
    </ul>
