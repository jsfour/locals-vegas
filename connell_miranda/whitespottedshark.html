<p class="style1">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">These sharks actually enjoy living in an aquarium style setting. These   sharks are quite content to nap most of the day in a cave or under a coral.These sharks pose no danger to our mermaids or divers, in fact, their teeth   are very small and they prefer to dig up small invertebrates to feed on. They   can reach a length of just over 3 feet and are capable of laying eggs. </p>
