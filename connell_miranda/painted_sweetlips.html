<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p class="style1">This fish is found in lagoons and seaward reefs of the Indo-Pacific. Adults   tend to be solitary,   while juveniles prefer to live in shallow lagoons. Both like to feed on   crustaceans, mollusks and smaller fishes. When fully grown, they will reach   nearly 3 feet in length. </p>
<p class="style1">Most types of Sweetlips have small mouths with large fleshy lips and they   usually undergo dramatic color changes as they grow. . As a juvenile matures it will   change from a bold black and white pattern to a whitish grey with numerous small   black spots over most of its upper body and fins. </p>
