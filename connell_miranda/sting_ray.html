<p align="center" class="style2">Cownose Stingray </p>
<p class="style2">Stingrays are part of the shark family. Both sharks and stingrays alike have no bones   instead, they get their support structure from cartilage. Since cartalidge is lighter then bone mass, Stingrays are able to swim freely wihout expending excess energy. Most Cownose Stingrays are found in shallow waters (up   to 100 feet deep) because they like to feed from the bottom and invertebrates   are their favorite foods. All stingrays have a barb on the top of their tails,   very near their body that they use for protection. If a stingray feels   threatened, he will whip his tail  in the direction of whatever is   threatening him. For safety reasons, all barb is removed from our aquarium.</p>
