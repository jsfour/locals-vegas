<p align="center" class="style1">Unicorn Tang </p>
<p class="style1">The Unicorn Fish is found in the Indo-Pacific regions of the world.&nbsp;   They prefer to live in areas with strong surge,with  small groups. The Unicorn Tang feeds on coarse leafy brown algae.&nbsp; Adult males tend to   have better developed horn, peduncular spines, and caudal filaments than females   of the same size. </p>
<p class="style1">Tangs are members of the Surgeonfish family.&nbsp; These fish have long   continuous dorsal and anal fins and crescent tailfins.&nbsp; The scalpel at the base   of their tailfin is very sharp and is used  for protection from   predators as well as a way of establishing itself with other fish.&nbsp;</p>
