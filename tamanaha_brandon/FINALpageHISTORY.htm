                <div align="left"><span class="style7">In 1500 the Portuguese, led by explorer Pedro Alves Cabral, arrived in Brazil. One of the first measures taken by the new arrivals was the subjugation of the local population&ndash;the Brazilian Indians&ndash; in order to furnish the Portuguese with slave labor. The experience with the aborigines was a failure. The Indians quickly died in captivity or fled to their nearby homes. The Portuguese then began to import slave labor from Africa. On the other side of the Atlantic, free men and women were captured, loaded onto ghastly slave ships and sent on a nightmarish voyage that for most would end in perpetual bondage. </span></div></td>

              <h4 class="style10">Origins </h4>
              <span class="style7">The Africans first arrived by the hundreds and later by the thousands. They brought with them their culture, vibrant and different from the European one, a culture that was not stored away in books or museums but rather in the body, mind, heart, and soul. A culture that was transmitted from father to son, from the initiate to the novice throughout the generations. There was candombl&eacute;, a religion: the berimbau, a musical instrument: vatap&aacute;, a food: and so many other things-in short a way of life. </span>
                <p class="style7">The origins of capoeira&ndash;whether African or Brazilian&ndash;are cause for controversy to this day; different and opposing theories have been created to explain how it all began. Capoeira is a synthesis of dances, fights and musical instruments from different cultures, from different African regions. It is a synthesis created on Brazilian soil, probably in Salvador, the capital of the state of Bahia, under the regime of slavery primarily during the nineteenth century.</p>
              <h3 class="style9">During Slavery </h3>
              <span class="style7">Starting around 1814, capoeira and other forms of African cultural expression suffered repression and were prohibited in some places by the slave masters and overseers. Capoeira began to be persecuted in a process which would culminate with its being outlawed in 1892. Why was capoeira suppressed? The motives were many. &bull; It gave the Africans a sense of nationality. &bull; It developed self-confidence in individual capoeira practitioners. &bull; It created small, cohesive groups. * It created dangerous and agile fighters &bull; Sometimes the would injure themselves during the capoeira game, which was not desirable from an economic point of view </span>
                <p class="style7">The berimbau is a one stringed instrument with a gourd attached: its simplicity belies the range of sound an experienced player can summon from it. The berimbau is accompanied by the atababaque (similar to the conga drum), hand clapping, and singing. According to one prevalent theory, capoeira was a fight that was disguised as a dance so that it could be practiced unbeknownst to the white slave owners. </p>
              <h4 class="style7">&nbsp;</h4>
              <h4 class="style7">&nbsp;</h4>
              <h4 class="style9">The Recent Years </h4>
              <p class="style7">In the 1940's Bahian capoeiristas began to immigrate to Rio, and later to Sao Paolo and other cities. None- theless, until the 1960's, the uncontested mecca for Brazilian capoeiristas continued to be Salvador and the state of Bahia. In Rio as well as in Sao Paulo, a new cord system inspired by the Asian martial arts was adopted as a means of attracting more students by giving a &quot;clean&quot; image of a new and organized capoeira. Capoeira Nowadays Although a few traditional Angola mestres kept on teaching, they were completely eclipsed by the new style that had it origins in Bimba's Capoeira Regional. But unexpectedly, there has been a revival of the traditional Capoeira Angola. Fortunately, some of the old mestres were still around, and returned to the capoeira scene with great strength, bringing back roots and values that had seemed completely lost. </p>
